# XHTTP over UDP (HTTP/3, QUIC)

# ⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT USE ON CELLULAR DATA.
## They throttle UDP heavily. Just don't, okay?

# Perks
- UDP based, less delay
- if a packet gets lost, the whole stream isnt stalled
- good for gaming
# Cons
- your upload speed will drop, prepare for it. Couldn't find a workaround.
- trash on cellular
- some shitty ISPs might throttle udp on fiber too
# Requirements 
- late
